# Introduction

## What is sunbeam?

Sunbeam is a command-line launcher, similar to spotlight, rofi or raycast.

It allows you to build interactives UIs from simple scripts, and share them as git repositories.

## Why sunbeam?

I love TUIs, but I spent way to much time writing them.

I used a lot of application launchers, but all of them had some limitations.

Sunbeam supports:

- Running on all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- Scripts written in any language, as long as they can output JSON
- Generating complex UIs compose of list, forms, details...
