# Introduction

## What is sunbeam?

Sunbeam is a command-line launcher, similar to spotlight, rofi or raycast.
It allows you to build interactives UIs from simple scripts.

## Why sunbeam?

I love TUIs, but I spent way to much time writing them.

I used a lot of application launchers, but all of them had some limitations.

Sunbeam supports:

- Running on all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- Commands written in any language, as long as they can output JSON
- Generating powerful UIs composed of a succession of pages
