# Alacritty

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is a cross-platform terminal emulator.

You can use it as a sunbeam client with this config.

```yml
{{#include ./alacritty.yml}}
```

If you don't plan to use Alacritty as your primary terminal,
you can just save it as `~/.config/alacritty.yml`.

```sh
curl https://pomdtr.github.io/sunbeam/book/clients/alacritty.yml > ~/.config/alacritty.yml
```
